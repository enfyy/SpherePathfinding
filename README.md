# SpherePathfinding
This was just something i was doing in order to kill time.
Its A* Pathfinding on a sphere. It kind of works. Its super slow and unoptimized.
My approach is probably stupid because i could just use the Great Circle distance to find the distance between to points
but instead i used the mesh of a cube that was transformed into a sphere as a grid.
